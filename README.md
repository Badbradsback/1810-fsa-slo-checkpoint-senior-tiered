Welcome to your final checkpoint at Fullstack Academy!

## Resources

Except for existing *codebases* (from workshops / checkpoints / projects you've done, or library / solution code), you are allowed to use any resources you'd like. That includes all documentation and workshop *instructions*.

Please make sure you complete specs located in the following files:

`tests/01.js`

`tests/02.js`

#### You MUST complete 01 and 02 tests in this order, and they MAY depend on eachother.  This checkpoint is organized in tiers. Each tier will require you to work across the stack, setting up the necessary functionality for the tests in the next tier. The tiers will increase in difficulty as you progress.

## Getting started

**Fork** and clone this repository. Then execute the following to run all tests:

```bash
npm install
```

To run all the tests, run `npm test`. To run only _specific_ test suites, you can optionally run the following:

```bash
npm run test-tier-1
npm run test-tier-2
```

To only run a specific `describe` or `it`, you can also chain `.only`:

```js
it.only('does something', testFunc);
```

## Submit

1. `git add -A`
2. `git commit -m 'submission for deadline'`
3. `git push origin master`
